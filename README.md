In this task following features are implemented

1. User can login using their email address but he has to first create a password from their gmail account.( This is only implemented for gmail right now).
2. after login, user will be redirected to their an "inbox" page where he can check all his emails.
3. On onbox page i added a link to " send email" to send an email to any other email address.
4. These features can only be accessible after login.
5. Basic validations are implemented.

1. Clone this repo
2. run "bundle install"
3. run db:setup and run db:migrate
4. run "rails s"
